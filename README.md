## Standartized Development Root for Mainsail Docs using Jekyll

### Requirements

A proper installation of Docker and Docker Compose according to your System/OS.

### Setup

**Open config in your prefered Text Editor and modify to your needs**
The config file is well documented.

_**Note: Use a Texteditor that is capable of using End Of Line Sequence in Unix Format! ( "LF" )
Those are for example: Atom, Sublime, VSCode or Notepad++ **_

### Launch our trap, to cage in Jekyll :)

        docker-compose run --service-ports jekyll

**You can talk to Jekyll safely through:**

_Open your favorite Browser and type:_

        http://127.0.0.1:4000

for the live rendered preview.

Now go on, do your "effing" Job!
